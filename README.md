# Wheather & Natural Disaster Alert System

### Hello Coders !!!
<br>

It is a python coded program which alerts the netizens of the ill-effected areas about the incoming disaster and also alerts the nearest rescue forces and other government authorities about it.
<br>
<br>

It is done by locating the user and if there is any natural disaster incoming, then the residents will get the alerts beforehand so that they can prepare themselves.

## Personal Note

Ignore all the files except `alert system.py`. The other files may or may not work. But the main backend file is `alert system.py`. Just fill up the api key and other required details yourself after setting up. Make sure to enter the details in place of `NA` otherwise the code won't work.
