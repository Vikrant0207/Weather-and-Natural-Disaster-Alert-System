# Wheather & Natural Disaster Alert System

It is a python coded program which alerts the netizens of the ill-effected areas about the incoming disaster and also alerts the nearest rescue forces and other government authorities about it.

It is done by locating the user and if there is any natural disaster incoming, then the residents will get the alerts beforehand so that they can prepare themselves.

#### NOTE : 
The interface and the backend is not interconnected. The backend is completely functional.
